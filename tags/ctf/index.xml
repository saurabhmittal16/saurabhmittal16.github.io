      <description>I participated in Hack The Box&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2021 this week. I was only able to solve 11 challenges (excluding the welcome challenge) but overall it was a fun event. The challenges were nice and did not need any form of guessing.
WEB - Inspector Gadget This was the entry level web challenge and the flag was split in 3 parts which were then placed in the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files as comments.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, I participated in the UTCTF 2021 but was unable to spend a lot of time on the challenges. One of the challenge I worked on was the recur challenge in the Reverse Engineering category. The challenge was not that hard but I had fun working on it so I decided to write a writeup for the challenge.
The challenge had a binary file attached with it and the description of the challenge was</description>

      <description>I participated in the WPICTF over the weekend and it was a great experience. The challenges were fun and hard enough to keep things interesting. I solved a few challenges but the part that makes me happy is that I solved 2 out of the 4 pwn problems. In this post, I will explain how I solved the two pwns - dorsia1 and dorsia3.
dorsia1 The source codes of some of the challenges were placed in a video.</description>

      <title>ROP Emporium - Pivot Writeup</title>

      <description>I recently came across the ropemporium challenges while looking for resources to learn Return Oriented Programming (ROP). I think that the challenges are very good and the difficulty increases with the problems which keep things interesting. The challenge this writeup is about is the pivot challenge. I will be using the 32 bit binary for the explanation purpose but the solution is pretty much the same for the 64-bit version.</description>
