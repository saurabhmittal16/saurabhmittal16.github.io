      <description>I participated in the WPICTF over the weekend and it was a great experience. The challenges were fun and hard enough to keep things interesting. I solved a few challenges but the part that makes me happy is that I solved 2 out of the 4 pwn problems. In this post, I will explain how I solved the two pwns - dorsia1 and dorsia3.
dorsia1 The source codes of some of the challenges were placed in a video.</description>
