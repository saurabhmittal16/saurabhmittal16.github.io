Hi, I am **_Saurabh Mittal_**. I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Technology, Computer Science Engineering, from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in). I am a Full Stack Developer with experience in web app development.

Here's a few things I have worked with -

- ReactJS
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Python
- Flutter

I build stuff for fun, some which are available on my [Github](https://github.com/saurabhmittal16) profile. Some of my projects can be found [here](/projects).

I enjoy participating in CTF challenges under the name [@sorvast](https://ctftime.org/team/109717) (_just a beginner_)
